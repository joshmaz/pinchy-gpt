## About

**Join the New England Pinball League!**
The NEPL is the world's largest pinball league. We play at over 25 locations spread throughout New England. While the NEPL does have some of the world's best players, we pride ourselves on being open to all skill levels and emphasizing fun over cutthroat competition.

We also pride ourselves on being a very open community. Everyone is welcome to play regardless of age, race, or sexual orientation — we even allow Yankee fans.

Finals are split up into five divisions with equal payouts for each division. Everyone has a chance to qualify for finals and bring home cash prizes. Everyone who plays a full season will have a chance to win a brand-new Stern Pro-level pinball machine.

Dues for the league are **$40 per season plus coin drop/house fee (usually $10)**. New players and kids under 12 have the option to play dues-free for the first season. Free players aren't eligible for prize money.

The season consists of **8 weeks plus a finals** (see [NEPL.org](https://nepl.org) for complete rules).

IFPA WPPR point submissions are up to the individual sites. If WPPR points are important to you, please check with your home site to see if they plan on applying for them.

In the New England Pinball League, every player has a chance to win a brand new Stern Pro pinball machine. The league will give one away at the Season 35 finals on December 7th.
