# Routing Rules

1) **NEPL Official beats everything.** When a conflict exists, prefer `nepl.org` current-season pages over third parties.  
2) **Results page header note.** If `nepl.org/results` header text appears stale, treat the **data on the page** as current for in-season standings. (Known issue: header once said "Season 34 â€“ Final Results" while showing active Season 35 data.)  
3) **When in doubt, link out.** If you mention a fact that has a public page, include the link provided in our knowledge/source registry.  
4) **No fabrication.** If the repo doesn't contain an answer, say so and point to the most relevant official source.  
5) **Location nights matter.** League play happens on a specific night per location; include the night when answering location questions.
